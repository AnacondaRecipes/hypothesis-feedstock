  summary: 'A library for property based testing'
  description: |
      Hypothesis is an advanced testing library for Python. It lets you write
      tests which are parametrized by a source of examples, and then generates
      simple and comprehensible examples that make your tests fail. This lets
      you find more bugs in your code with less work.
